This respository contains the code and some data and data samples used to create the figures and analysis of the paper 
(Durante et al., 2024), Capturing the Loop Current by its ends. Part I: The New Canek Velocity Database.

Requirements: We are using MATLAB version 23.2.0.2409890 (R2023b), October 4, 2023. 
Some intrinsic functions may not be present of work differently in older versions.

The file New_Canek_Database_2024.nc can be downloaded from [zenodo link], and will be needed for some of the scripts to work.

Data availability

Due to confidentiality agreements with the Cuban government, the raw data and the gridded data from the Florida section can only be made available 
to bona fide researchers subject to a non-disclosure agreement. 

The freely available database contains:

  - 8.4 years of gridded horizontal velocity maps (U, V) from the Yucatan section and their associated error maps.
  - The transport time series from both the Yucatan and Florida sections and their associated uncertainties.

Some raw data samples are provided in the folder Data to illustrate examples of the computations presented in the paper.
